##jdbc.sqlonly	
	#Logs only SQL. SQL executed within a prepared statement is automatically shown with it's bind arguments replaced with the data bound at that position, for greatly increased readability.
##jdbc.sqltiming	
	#Logs the SQL, post-execution, including timing statistics on how long the SQL took to execute.
##jdbc.audit	
	#Logs ALL JDBC calls except for ResultSets. This is a very voluminous output, and is not normally needed unless tracking down a specific JDBC problem.
##jdbc.resultset	
	#Even more voluminous, because all calls to ResultSet objects are logged.
##jdbc.resultsettable	
	#Log the jdbc results as a table. Level debug will fill in unread values in the result set.
##jdbc.connection	
	#Logs connection open and close events as well as dumping all open connection numbers. This is very useful for hunting down connection leak problems.
